Surfs_up
#CHALLENGE OVERVIEW (DJB)
this project explores the weather data in hawaii and introduces us to dependencies like sql lite and flask. We used "advanced data storage" from the hawaii.sqlite file to retreive temperature data. Can this surf shop function as a viable year round business? mostly likey, yes. 

##SOURCES
Hawaii.sqlite, climate_analysis.ipynb
Python sql toolkit, anaconda powershell, object relational mapper, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and flask 

##results
the results are included in the following images below. the 50% percentile for June was 75, and for dec it was 71. This indicates that it is likely good to go for year round business, further, the max year round was 83, and 85 respectivly. 

##summary
I would summize that even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for surfing. I would also want to do a costs analysis on the ice cream. It would also be a good idea to get further summary statistics on the waves, # of tourists, travel conditions etc etc

For specificity, I would like to delve into the summary statistics of temperatures recorded by station for each month. This can help determine geopgraphically where in Oahu to build the prospective shop. By comparing the variances in temperatures and the frequencies recorded, we can narrow in on an optimal location.


I would like to review other variables that are correlated with optimal tourist timing & beach and surfing weather. Sunch varibles include precipitation, wave swells and wind condition. Overall, Hawaii is obviously a great place to open a surf shop, but the real estate is likely very expensive, We would want to analyze the real estate comparables for our shop.
